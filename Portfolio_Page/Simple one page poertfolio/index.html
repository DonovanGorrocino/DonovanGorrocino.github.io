                    <h2>Welcome to our project site!</h2>
                    <p>We as Tec students identified a problem that we ourselves have experienced. As we talk with our friends and fellow Tec students we realise the problem is very alive and counterproductive. We see this problem across al careers in Tec. We as a team think this is an important problem to aproach. We have desided that the problem to tackle is that of books for students. It is very common that at the local bookstore runs out of the most demanded books. These books can sometimes be very specific so availability in outside bookstores is not always very common. There is no tracking system to give the students some kind of insight of what's going on. So join us as we try to make sense of the situation. </p>

                            <h3 class="text-center">Investigation and Inquiry</h3>
                            <p>This is the  starting point for us. The investigation is of the utmost importance. This is what the whole proyect is going to be based of. We will explain the different methodologys we will use to get the answers we are trying to get and the answers we still don't know we want.</p>

                            <h3 class="text-center">Polls</h3>
                            <p>We have decided to go around tec making polls. Simply ask students basic question will ultimately shift the conversation. The answer we get from our fellow student will also steer the same questions we are asking. </p>

                            <h3 class="text-center">Focus Groups</h3>
                            <p>Another tool we will use is called a "Focus Group". In this methodology a small group of people is gathered (between 6 and 12) and the difference with a simple poll where you only ask questions, the focus group is centered around the idea of having a discussion, an exchange of ideas; with, of course, your target customer/demographic. We will act as moderators in order to avoid any deviation from the topic. </p>

                            <h3 class="text-center">Benchmark</h3>
                            <p>We know the simple solutions that we ourselves use. Sometimes is very efficient to ditch the bookstore entirely. We sometimes use PDFs from the books that we are comanded to buy; however a PDF resolves so many problems that in a lot of cases it is prefered than a regular old physical book. Another solution is the wonder that is Amazon or other third-party e-store. Amazon for example has a vast amount of variety not only in books, it has a tracking system that works fine and it can sometimes have good sales.</p>

                            <h3 class="text-center">Academic Research</h3>
                            <p>Experts claim that the shortage of books in a high-school or above level is due to the overpricing of essential book for students, which these are supposed to cost less, therefor not many are ordered, due to the unwillingness of bookstore to risk a small loss. It is calculated that the average U.S.A. student spends around 700-1000 dollars on books, so with a relatively small order of books and a high demand, the books shortage is an almost complete assurance.    </p>
                        </li>

                            <h3 class="text-center">Social Impact</h3>
                            <p>We can safely say that this problem has a number of ramifications and implications. A thing that we consider very serious is the intelectual property situation. When is much easier to download a PDF than to buy a book you are hurting the people who take the time and effort to make quaility educational books. You are not supporting the creative inventors in any way and that makes everyone lose. There are other importan implications for this problem, like the detrimental academic performance of the student as a result of lack of the needed textbook.</p>
